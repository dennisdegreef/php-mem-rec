# php-mem-rec

It is a project that aims to solve Memory profiling task to convert it into an easy task. 

It is divided into two parts, a CLI command that acts as a Parser and a completely UI web app.

## The command line tool.

It is a unix like OS script compliant that proccesses memory profiling files generated by Xdebug, right now this information is available by enabling xdebug.trace
option in Xdebug config but it is not easy task to use it and manipulate in terms of getting some kind of intelligent information 
the programmer need without waiting too much time to be parsed and examined due most of the parser aout there are written in php
and it is a real hit iterative work.

This is why the solution is designed in AWK, an extremely efficient language to work with streams that comes by default in unix and Linux
platforms, It can parse in seconds what it takes 15 minutes for a php script. What it does is parse original xdebug files into 
easy to read new files that can be automatically used by the other half of this project, the web app.

## The web app.

The web app is designed to bring profiling an step further by revealing accurate information about memory consumption per method 
which it is not present in projects like webgrind. The main aim with this webapp is to deliver an extremely easy to use tool that 
can represent xdebug data into really valuable information for the programmer interested into achieving memory consumption friendly code.

It is also my willing that if you feel by anyhow interested into participating in the project simply do, it is intended to be a collaborative product and all hands will be appreciated
